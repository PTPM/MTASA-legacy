Within each team, the different classes have different weapons. Some classes have special \"medic\" powers, and usually spawn with less weaponry. Medics have a slightly paler colour so you can identify them on the radar.\n\nThere is an unarmed \"Prime Minister\" (PM) class (yellow). Closely guarding the Prime Minister is the \"bodyguard\" team (green), consisting of all the bodyguard classes. Then there are the more heavily-armed \"cops\" (blue).

Medics can transfer some of their health to other players using /heal\n\n\nSome maps have a series of optional tasks for the PM to do, marked on the map by red blips. While completing these tasks will not guarantee victory (they can be ignored if you wish), a useful bonus will be given to the PM for each completed task. It is in the best interest of the Terrorists to stop all tasks from being completed. When a task is being attempted, the task blip on the radar will turn green to indicate it is being used. A small description of the task and a countdown will also appear on the screen to show how long left until completion (Psychos cannot see this).\n\n\nSome maps also have a series of objectives for the PM to complete. So rather than simply staying alive, the PM must complete all the objectives within the round or he will lose. The current objective will be shown on the radar as a red blip and announced on the screen. Unlike tasks, no information about the time needed to complete the objective will be shown to the Terrorists, so they must act fast to stop the PM."}
